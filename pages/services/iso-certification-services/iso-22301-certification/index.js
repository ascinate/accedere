                                <p className="mt-4"> ISO 22301 becomes ever so important as customers and federal regulators 
                                began to recognize the role of business continuity in mitigating the effects of incidents to an 
                                organization. This has caused an increase in the adoption of ISO 22301 to gain assurance that 
                                stakeholders and the related people and functions of an organization have the appropriate business 
                                continuity policies and 
                                processes designed, implemented, and that those processes are effective.</p>
