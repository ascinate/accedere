                              27000 / ISO 27701 Certifications.
                              </p>

                              <p className="text-white"> Our ISO 27000, ISO 27701, ISO 27701 Certifications, Data Security & Privacy certification services cover Security and Privacy that enable our customers to have SOC 2 and ISO 27001 :2013 or ISO 27701 :2019 (PIMS) or other 
                              27xxx audits under one roof, thus saving considerable costs and efforts.</p>

                              <p className="text-white"> As the SOC 2 broadly covers many of the ISO 27001 certification requirements, it makes sense for organizations to combine the audits by us under one brand. The AICPA SOC 2 Type 2 engagements require continuous monitoring for evaluating the operative effectiveness of the controls, in parallel we are also able to evaluate most of the ISO
                               27000 controls pertaining to our customers' environment.</p>

                                <p className="text-white"> Thus, this is a win-win situation for our customers as they can get the ISO 27000 and ISO 27701 certifications along with the SOC 2 Type 2 Compliance reports under one roof (brand) and perhaps conducted together to save considerable time and effort. The new ISO 27002 :2022 has recently been 
                                announced and will define the upcoming ISO 27001 standard.</p>

                                Technologies are constantly changing and thus we need to keep pace with the environment
                                 and adapt a process of change to enable the use of these new technologies in a safe manner. 
                                 Implementing an ISMS for certification under ISO 27001 :2013 is one way to ensure that your 
                                 organization follow a process for its information systems to provide an assurance to its
