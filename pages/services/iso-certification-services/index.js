                       Certifications.</p>
                       <p className="text-white"> Our ISO 27000, ISO 27701, ISO 27701 Certifications, Data Security 
                       & Privacy certification services cover Security and Privacy that enable our customers to 
                       have SOC 2 and ISO 27001 :2013 or ISO 27701 :2019 (PIMS) or other 27xxx audits under one roof, 
                       thus saving considerable costs and efforts.</p>
                       <p className="text-white">
                       As the SOC 2 broadly covers many of the ISO 27001 certification requirements, it makes sense
                        for organizations to combine the audits by us under one brand. The AICPA SOC 2 Type 2
                         engagements require continuous monitoring for evaluating the operative effectiveness 
                         of the controls, in parallel we are also able to evaluate most of the ISO 27000
                        controls pertaining to our customers&apos; environment.
                       </p>
                       <p className="text-white"> Thus, this is a win-win situation for our customers as they can get the ISO 27000 
                       and ISO 27701 certifications along with the SOC 2 Type 2 Compliance reports under one 
                       roof (brand) and perhaps conducted together to save considerable time and effort. 
                       The new ISO 27002 :2022 has recently
                        been announced and will define the upcoming ISO 27001 standard.</p>

                <p> Accedere will take action and deal with incorrect references to certification status or misleading use of certification documents, marks, or audit reports. The action may include requests for correction and corrective action, suspension, withdrawal of certification,
                 publication of the transgression, and if necessary legal action.</p>

                 <h2> Handling of Client Complaint and Observations </h2>
                 <p> In case of a complaint/observation against Accedere., the Quality manager 
                 analyses the issue to determine if there is a system error or personal error.
                  The root cause and correction, corrective actions are determined. The correction is effected 
                  immediately to satisfy the complainant. This may include training/counseling the person involved. 
                  In case of a complaint/observation against a certified client, the Quality Manager studies the 
                  complaint and discusses it with the auditor (last audit). If the complaint is found genuine and 
                  valid i.e., indicates a system failure, the complaint is sent to the client for a response. 
                  No confidential reports or information will be sent to complainants without written permission 
                  from the client. Adequate time is given to the client for a response. The quality manager shall 
                  communicate with the complainant at the end of the process detailing the findings and formally 
                  close the complaint. A copy of the correspondence is kept in the client file for records and 
                  the same is 
                 passed to the auditor during the next audit.</p>

                 <h2> Handling of Appeals </h2>
                 <p> Any company or organization that fails to satisfy an audit or surveillance 
                 may appeal against the decision. Where an appeal is received the following procedure 
                 will be followed. The MD will appoint the members of the appeals committee under the leadership
                  of the MD who will hear the appeal and determine the outcome. In case, MD is part of the 
                  audit/certification team, MD shall decide the investigating officer for the appeals process. 
                  In such a scenario MD shall approach Impartiality Committee and/or Accedere team to provide a
                   decision on the appeal. The decision on the appeal shall be taken based on the decision by 
                   the Accedere committee and the Impartiality Committee. Results of the appeal will be reported
                    to the board of directors. In case of an appeal made by a client against a decision made 
                    by an auditor, Lead auditor, or certification committee, the appeal shall be recorded by
                     Quality Manager and forwarded to Appeal Subcommittee. The appeal subcommittee shall 
                     review the appeal, investigate. The appeal subcommittee may also direct any other lead 
                     auditor to visit the site and determine the validity of the appeal. The decision 
                     taken by the Appeal subcommittee shall be communicated to the client and Quality
                      Manager for necessary action. The case is also discussed during the next MRM and
                       Impartiality Committee meeting. In special cases, the case may be 
                 discussed with Impartiality Committee members on a one-to-one basis .</p>
