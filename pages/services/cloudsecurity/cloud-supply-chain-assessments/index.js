                            <p> The most common challenges and limitations that companies face when using cloud-based 
                            technologies are data security and privacy, outdated business thinking, system availability, 
                            as well as lack of customization.Data in the cloud should be accessed only by authorized members, 
                            i.e., trustworthy supply chain partners. Cloud computing systems as software products cannot always
                            ensure confidentiality and as a result run an increasing risk of being intruded on by hacking 
                            systems.Additionally, possible data acquisition by competing companies would 
                            pose an imminent threat to the whole supply chain.</p>


                            <p> The sharing of data and information with the public implies a fundamental change 
                            in the traditional way of working and thinking, which can be a significant cultural business 
                            issue Up until now, most companies have been keeping a secret piece of information regarding 
                            production processes or supply chain networks. Those companies are concerned with wide sharing and 
                            disclosure of such data could lead to the loss of their competitive advantage. Meanwhile, 
                            adopting all the supply chain partners, who have been managing their operations till now with 
                            common on-premises infrastructure, should learn how to use the new cloud systems effectively.Such 
                            adaptations cannot be completed in a short period of time since the transition to a more open way 
                            of business strategy needs a slow pace to carry out.We have identified and listed a few major
                            supply chain security risks, which you need to be aware of and should be addressed in your 
                            incident response plan/strategy to prevent security vulnerabilities

                          <p> Cloud computing provides the ability for multiple users to collaborate on projects or
                           documents in the cloud. This point has been reiterated and reinforced recently as a major
                            selling point to businesses. 
                          </p>
                          <p> This makes cloud computing a great option for the assessment of the proposed Agility 
                          index since all the SC partners around the world can provide their level of implementation
                           of the deployed agile practicesin the cloud and all the filled information can be
                            treated to provide a clear overview of both theindividual companies and the whole
                             SC&apos;s Agility 
                          behavior. According to several authors andpractitioners, 
                          cloud computing is an unavoidable path for the supply chain management.</p>
