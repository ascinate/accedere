                           <p className="mt-4"> Manufacturers, producers, and distribution companies (organizations) must manage a complex network of plants, service providers, and suppliers to operate efficiently and meet commitments to customers. At the same time, the threats to and vulnerabilities of each supplier in the chain have increased significantly. When a supply chain is disrupted, the organization is at risk of failing to meet production or delivery commitments it has made to its customers.
                            Causes of disruption to supply chains include the following: </p>
