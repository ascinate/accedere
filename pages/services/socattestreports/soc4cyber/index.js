A critical element of any cybersecurity risk management program is the formulation of objectives by management. Management establishes cybersecurity objectives that address cybersecurity risks that could affect the achievement of the entity&apos;s overall business objectives (including compliance, reporting, and operational objectives). They may vary depending on the environment in which the entity operates, the entity&apos;s mission and vision, the overall business 
                              objectives established by management, risk appetite, and other factors.

                                <p className="mt-4"> Cybersecurity risk has become a front-and-center issue in today&apos;s global economy. The media is rife with reports of cyberattacks ranging from major customer records thefts and health care records breaches to political incidents. Unfortunately, we are living in a world where the risk of a cyber intrusion is no longer a question of if, but a question of when. In fact, according to the World Economic data fraud or theft, and cyberattacks rank as top
                                 risks on their list of Top Ten Risks in Terms of Likelihood. </p>

                                <p className="mt-4"> Cybersecurity brings extraordinary challenges. Organizations face varying threats with varying impacts—all in an environment marked by rapid technological change. What&apos;s more, various stakeholders must gather information and converse about cybersecurity between and among each other. The nature of cybersecurity challenges requires that every sector of the economy plays a role. While government policy and activity will be important in promoting cybersecurity resilience, the energy, agility, and innovation of the private sector must be harnessed as well. The auditing profession will do its part by playing a key role in helping organizations—public 
                                and private—adapt to this challenging landscape. </p>
                                <p> Given the high-profile nature of cyber-attacks on corporations, both the demand for information related to cybersecurity—and the need to facilitate robust conversations on these topics—have grown exponentially across major stakeholder groups. Board members: Boards of directors need information about the entity&apos;s cybersecurity program and the cyber threats facing the entity to help the boards fulfill their oversight responsibilities. They also want information that will help them evaluate the entity&apos;s effectiveness in managing cybersecurity risks. </p>
