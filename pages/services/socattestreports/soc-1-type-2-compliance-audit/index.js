                              <p className="text-white mt-4"> One of the most important reports for a third party (vendor) data security and SOX compliance 
                              is the SOC Report, SOC 1 Report or SOC 2 Type 2 Report. The SOC Report, SOC 1 Report or SOC 2 Type 2 attest report provides an assurance on controls for SOX compliance. SOC compliance reports are part of AICPA&apos;s SSAE 18 Attest Standard that is now used for the SOC Report, SOC 1 Report or SOC 2 Type II, and SOC 3 reports. SOC reportswere known as SAS 3 since 1974, and as SAS 70 audit reports since 1992. In 2011 the SOC 1 was brought under SSAE 16 Standard and SOC 2 under AT 101. Finally, in 2017 the SSAE 16 along with other SSAE standards got merged into one SSAE 18, bringing all SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 reports under SSAE 18. This is the main difference between SSAE 16 vs 18 pertaining to
                               SOC compliance reports for Cybersecurity.</p>
                             <p className="text-white mt-4"> SOC now stands for &apos;System and Organization Controls&apos;. The definition got changed in 2017 from the earlier one as &apos;Service Organization Controls&apos; as these compliance reports were mainly being used for vendor(third-party) compliance as these organizations are also service organizations. Now SOC reports such as SOC for Cybersecurity and SOC for Supply Chain can be used by entities for their internal use and not necessarily by third-parties or vendor compliance.The SSAE 18 Auditor or SOC Auditor 
                            auditing these service organizations is called Service Auditor.</p>

                                controls over a period of minimum 6 months to maximum 12 months in contrast to certifications 
                                such as ISO/IEC 27001 that provides a certificate which is valid for 3 years. For missing periods 
                                immediately after the report, some User Entities or User Auditors may insist on a SOC Bridge Letter. 
                                A SOC compliance report can be about 100 pages or so depending on the controls reported on. The SOC 2
                                Type 2 report covers of all the applicable controls for the applicable criteria that are reported 
                                by the SOC Auditor (Service Auditor). The SOC audit report is now of 4 sections, Section 1 is 
                                the Auditors Opinion, Section II is the Management Assertion, Section III is the Description 
                                Criteria or System Description and Section IV is a detailed list of controls as per applicable 
                                TSC 2017 criteria or the applicable control objectives along with the results of the auditors&apos; 
                                test of controls. A SOC report can be qualified or unqualified. A SOC report could be

                                <p> A SOC compliance report can only be issued only by a licensed CPA, ideally a CPA firm, as a SOC Auditor, also known as a Service Auditor. A SOC 2 Type 2 report mirrors the ISAE 3000 and the SOC 1 Type 2 report mirrors the ISAE 3402, based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements. A Licensed CPA Firm such as ours can issue a joint SOC and ISAE report. To issue a SOC compliance report for a public (listed) entity, the CPA Firm must be registered with the PCAOB. A CPA signing the SSAE 18, SOC compliance report and the audit team needs to be Independent as this is an AICPA Attest
