                                <p className="mt-4"> Many companies exploring this new privacy doctrine, in the Unites 
                                States and elsewhere, are asking “does the GDPR even apply to me?” and “how can the 
                                GDPR have province over our business if we&apos;re not even located in the European Union?” 
                                The GDPR applies to any organization that is offering goods or services (irrespective of payment) 
                                to residents of the European Union or who is monitoring residents of the European Union. Monitoring 
                                in the GDPR framework is referred to as “profiling” and is defined as the automated analysis or 
                                predicting of behavior, location, movements, reliability, interests, personal preferences, 
                                health, economic situation, performance, etc. It does not matter whether an organization operates 
                                physically within Europe (a concept referred to as “extraterritoriality”).</p>
