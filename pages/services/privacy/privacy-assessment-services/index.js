                       <p className="text-white"> Privacy has grabbed the attention of Boards of Directors (BoD&apos;s) across regions as organizations look to comply with new privacy regulations and compliance mandates such as GDPR, CCPA-California Privacy Act, Colorado Privacy Act, New York Privacy Act, India Data Protection Bill, and other US Privacy laws as well as other Global Privacy mandates and others. Privacy is the new buzzword, and the potential impact is very real. Personal data were processed for political and economic reasons without users&apos; consent, as happened in the Cambridge Analytics event. In view of such recent incidents, the failure of the EU Safe Harbor and the Privacy Shield to provide real protection, privacy laws are now changing and have become more stringent. The magnitude of recent
                        GDPR fines have added to the Privacy complexity.</p>

                        <p> The majority of organizations until recently have been using the mainly legal team to
                         manage privacy compliance. Since GDPR the situation has evolved, as privacy now is not 
                         just managing cookies or opt-ins or opt-outs. Privacy compliance requires a holistic and 
                         collaborative approach with team members from Business, IT, 
                        Security, Legal, and others. A siloed approach does not work. </p>
                        

                        <p> Organizations need a Privacy Governance Program with a top-down approach to manage privacy
                         risks and compliance challenges. One IAPP privacy report report indicated that less than 50% of 
                         the organizations have an internal or external assurance for privacy. When there are no internal 
                         or external privacy audits, organizations may not have knowledge of their privacy maturity 
                         and they may only understand the hard way when they have a data breach. The same report also
                          suggested that 90% of organizations use third-parties (vendors) to store or process data.
                         Some of these vendors may also be Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).</p>

                         <p> The cloud environment is not safe either. One of the top cloud risks is the
                          misconfigured servers that lead to data breaches. Another major risk is insecure APIs.
                           Organizations use API&apos;s to transfer data to the business partners without a secure architecture in place, and without conducting a proper 
                         vendor due diligence or evaluating the data flow lifecycle risks.</p>

                        <p> With the above mentioned privacy madates and other new expected mandates and 
                        stringent compliance requirements, organizations are feeling more challenging times ahead. 
                        The sheer amount of privacy & GDPR fines being levied has created enough scare
                         amongst the Board of Directors of large organizations.</p>
                        

                        <p> Concepts such as Privacy by Design, Data Minimization, 
                        Data De-identification using Anonymization, or Pseudonymization encryption
                         methods are causing several implementation challenges.</p>

                         <p> To overcome the privacy challenges, organizations need to establish a Privacy Governance 
                         Program with a senior person taking responsibility for the program by involving all organization 
                         stakeholders. Several tools such as privacy assessment tools, the NIST Privacy Framework discussed 
                         in our white paper can be very helpful in Privacy Governance. Organizations such as IAPP and ISCAA 
                         also offer many Privacy programs that help in overcoming Privacy Challenges. 
                         A periodic internal and external independent audit should be made mandatory 
                         by organizations to understand the level of maturity 
                         and of compliance towards the applicable privacy mandates.</p>

                        <p> To conduct an effective Privacy Impact Assessment, it is important to understand 
                        and take stock of the entire data life cycle management of the several data that the organization, 
                        collects, processes, and stores. Many organizations do not define the end life cycle of the data 
                        and keep them endlessly thus increasing the risks of a data breach in case it is not encrypted. Managing encryption keys too can be a challenge. Hence it is important for organizations to have stock of the entire organization data to define the end life as well as data deletion, procedures at the end of the data life cycle. To understand the data life cycle, it is also important to understand the data flows for every specific data set.
                         The NIST Privacy Tool can help organizations achieve this objective.</p>
