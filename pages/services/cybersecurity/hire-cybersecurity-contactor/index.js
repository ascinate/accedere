                        and objectives. With a mature, long-term security roadmap, the company can accelerate its 
                        security ROI and move its business forward. Accedere&apos;s contractors are mostly based out of 
                        India and will work on US time zones as applicable. This saves your hiring
                         costs and the visa issue that can take over a year or so to process. </p>
