                           <p>  With ICS increasingly getting integrated with corporate network and Internet for 
                           business requirements, it is obvious that ICS is opening itself to the world of attackers.
                            With cyber-attacks continue to escalate in frequency, severity, and impact year after year 
                            it is with this concern that it is
                            of paramount importance to ensure cybersecurity around such systems.</p>

                            Reliability Corporation (NERC) has imposed a six-figure penalty on a participant in 
                            the electric market for fundamentally failing to comply with
                             the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards.</p>

                  <p>Industrial control systems (ICS), which are part of the OT environment in industrial 
                  enterprises, encompass several types of control systems including supervisory control and 
                  data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other smaller control 
                  system configurations such as programmable logic controllers (PLC), remote terminal units
                   (RTU), intelligent electronic devices (IED) and other field devices.</p> 

                   <p> ICS systems were originally designed for increasing performance, reliability,
                    and safety by reducing manual efforts. Security 
                   was achieved by physical isolation, so-called airgap (security by obscurity). </p> 

                   <p> In the recent past attacks such as Stuxnet, Shamoon and Ukraine Energy, organizations have 
                   realized the importance of safeguarding the ICS and the IT-OT converged environments.
                    Today the world is talking about connecting everything to the internet. As the fourth industrial 
                    revolution (Industry 4.0) a term used to draw together cyber-physical systems, Internet of 
                    things (IoT) and Internet of Services starts to find more resonance with OEMs, system 
                    integrators and asset owners, it is a matter of time that we will see a lot of ICS information
                     being routed to sophisticated applications across the enterprises through a wide area network 
                     where security by obscurity is no longer a valid protection. Organizations and States have plans 
                     for connecting ICS to the Internet for projects involving such as smart grids, smart cities, etc.
                    which significantly increase the risk of intrusion from malicious actors. </p>
