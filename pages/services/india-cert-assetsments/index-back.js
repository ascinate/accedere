                       <p> On April 8, 2018, RBI issued to Banks a notification which specified mandates of storage of all end to end data transactions. Data localization is basically a government mandate for storing all the user data which is collected within each
                        jurisdiction on the servers across the entire country. </p>

                        <p> System providers are required to submit System Audit Reports (SAR) as per this mandate on 
                        a regular basis to comply with 
                        RBI&apos;s guidelines. These audits can only be conducted by CERT-In empaneled
                         auditors and the audit reports should be submitted to RBI periodically. </p>

                        <p> Since we&apos;re CERT-In empaneled auditors, we can conduct your audits and provide you 
                        with SAR in order to stay complaint with RBI&apos;s guidelines. </p>
